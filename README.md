This is a responsive Pomodoro Timer that helps improve focus and time management. You can set your own work and break times, choose themes like light, dark, or image backgrounds, and go fullscreen to stay distraction-free. The timer updates the remaining time in the browser tab title so you can track time while multitasking. It saves your progress using localStorage, so your settings and time donâ€™t reset on page reload. The design is mobile-friendly, simple to use, and includes a "Clear Settings" button to reset everything to default.
